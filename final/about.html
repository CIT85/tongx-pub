      <h1>About Website</h1>
      <p>
        I had originally wanted to create a portfolio that showcases all the work I've done so far including projects, and other webpages.
        With no real direction to go with, I just started adding a little bits of things that kind of relates to me like going out for events, or the pets I like.
        It was a fun time just building different things that kind of related to me in a way.
        So overall, this website is my personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is 100% for me. It's my portfolio and should showcase all the things I've been doing and also am doing up-to-date. Its my unprofessional work and also professional.

      </p>
      <p>
        I've always wanted to create something about me and put it out there for people to discover. It's like adding my personal skills and expertise for the rest of the world to see.
        While it may not be as good as I had wanted it, I'm gradually improving and thats whats most important to me.

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        In the future, I plan to use frameworks like React, tailwind, Vue, Etc. I want my website to be as responsive as it can be while retaining 100% consistency across the html pages.
        In terms of content, I want to add modals, carousel, and just really cool designs that will enhance the user experience.
