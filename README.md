## Hero Image Design

### Why you chose the image?
The image is a upbeat and fun time. I used it to encourage people to sign up for events or create their own.

### Where it appears
I choose to add a hero background cover to my Events Html page.

### Your design choices for placement, layout, and contrast
It's basically a header for my site. Its at the top centered and it has a message of "events" I set it to be a darker tone color for the text to pop out more not removing the essence of the photo.
